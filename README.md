# Mask-Illinois
This website provides a guide on making safe, home-made masks, and facilitates a seamless exchange process between Mask Donors and Donatees at the University of Illinois. The website is still under construction - once it is available (to be released soon), it will allow people in the Champaign community to donate/sell masks to recipients in need of masks. You can visit the website at https://maskserver.web.illinois.edu/.
